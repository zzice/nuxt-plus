Good products are built through iteration. Product iteration relies on user feedback. Understanding user behavior means mastering the basis for product iteration.

## 6.1 A Beginner's Guide to Website Statistics
As a website product owner, it is crucial to understand how users interact with your site. You should be familiar with the following concepts:

### 1. Unique Visitors
*   **Meaning:** The number of distinct users who visit your website within a specific time period. A user is counted as only one unique visitor, no matter how many times they visit.
*   **Why it's important:** This is the most basic metric, directly reflecting the size and appeal of your website's audience.
*   **Industry Benchmarks:**
    *   To earn $10,000/month from AdSense alone: around 1 million monthly visitors.
    *   To earn $10,000/month from subscriptions: 100k-300k monthly visitors (mainly from developed countries).
    *   An AI product that's a serious contender: over 1 million monthly visitors.
    *   A mid-tier AI product: 3-5 million monthly visitors.
    *   A top-tier AI product in a niche category: over 10 million monthly visitors.
*   **Suggestion:** Focusing on the growth trend of unique visitors is more meaningful than a single number. A steady growth curve is usually healthier than short-term spikes.

### 2. Bounce Rate
*   **Meaning:** The percentage of visitors who leave the site after viewing only one page.
*   **Note:** Search engines pay a lot of attention to this metric! They prefer to give priority traffic to high-quality websites. If users of a certain site always leave after one page, search engines will tend to think it's not a great site.
*   **Why it's important:** A high bounce rate usually indicates that visitors didn't find what they were looking for, or the website experience is poor.
*   **Industry Benchmarks:**
    *   Excellent: 20-40%
    *   Average: 40-60%
    *   Needs improvement: Over 70%
    *   *Exceptions:* For single-page websites, blog posts, or pages for specific information queries, a high bounce rate is normal.
*   **Suggestion:** Improving navigation, content relevance, and page load speed can reduce the bounce rate.

### 3. Average Session Duration
*   **Meaning:** The average amount of time visitors spend on your website.
*   **Note:** Search engines love this data! The longer the average user session, the more it proves you have a high-quality website.
*   **Why it's important:** A longer session duration usually means users are interested in the content and have high engagement.
*   **Industry Benchmarks:**
    *   Excellent: Over 5 minutes (some special categories like gaming websites can reach over 8 minutes).
    *   Average: 3 minutes
    *   Poor quality site: Less than 1 minute
*   **Suggestion:** Engaging content, easy-to-navigate design, and internal links can extend session duration.

### 4. Pageviews
*   **Meaning:** The total number of times all pages on the website have been viewed.
*   **Why it's important:** Reflects the overall traffic and content appeal of the website.
*   **Suggestion:** Analyze in conjunction with other metrics. High pageviews alone could be caused by a few visitors refreshing or browsing frequently.

### 5. Pages Per Session
*   **Meaning:** The average number of pages a visitor views in a single session.
*   **Why it's important:** A high number indicates that visitors are exploring your site in depth and are interested in multiple pages.
*   **Industry Benchmarks:**
    *   Excellent: Over 3 pages
    *   Average: 2-3 pages
    *   Needs improvement: Below 2 pages
*   **Suggestion:** Optimizing internal links and recommending related content can improve this metric.

### 6. Traffic Sources
*   **Meaning:** How visitors find your website, e.g., search engines, social media, direct visits, etc.
*   **Note:** For excellent websites, organic search traffic often exceeds 30%, and traffic from social media tends to be stable at over 20%.
*   **Why it's important:** Helps you understand which channels bring the most visitors to your site, allowing you to optimize your marketing strategy.
*   **Common Source Types:**
    *   Organic Search: Visitors who find your site through a search engine.
    *   Paid Search: Visitors who enter through paid ad clicks.
    *   Social Media: Traffic from platforms like Facebook, Twitter, etc.
    *   Direct: Visitors who type your URL directly into their browser.
    *   Referral: Visitors who enter by clicking a link from another website.
*   **Suggestion:** Don't rely too heavily on a single traffic source. Diversifying traffic channels can reduce risk.

### 7. Conversion Rate
*   **Meaning:** The percentage of visitors who complete a specific goal (e.g., purchase, registration, download).
*   **Why it's important:** Directly reflects the business effectiveness of the website and the achievement of user behavior goals.
*   **Industry Benchmarks:**
    *   *Subscription/Paid Conversion Rate:*
        *   Organic Traffic: Median is 0.5%, over 2% is excellent.
        *   Paid Traffic: 2%-8% (depends on ad precision and product strength).
    *   *Email List Sign-up Rate:* 2%-5%
    *   *E-commerce Purchase Rate:* Around 2%
*   **Suggestion:** Even a small increase in conversion rate can lead to significant revenue growth. Focus on user experience and clear calls-to-action.

### 8. Exit Rate
*   **Meaning:** The percentage of sessions for which a specific page was the last one viewed.
*   **Why it's important:** A page with a high exit rate may have problems or be a natural departure point.
*   **Suggestion:** Analyze whether high-exit-rate pages are natural endpoints like purchase confirmation or contact pages, or if they have issues that need to be optimized.

### 9. New vs. Returning Visitor Ratio
*   **Meaning:** The ratio of first-time visitors to repeat visitors.
*   **Why it's important:** Helps to understand the website's ability to attract new visitors and retain old ones.
*   **Industry Benchmarks:**
    *   New Visitors: 40-60%
    *   Returning Visitors: 40-60%
*   **Suggestion:** A healthy website should be able to both attract new visitors and maintain the loyalty of returning ones.

### 10. Device Type Distribution
*   **Meaning:** The percentage of visitors using different device types (mobile, tablet, desktop).
*   **Why it's important:** Helps ensure the website displays well on all devices.
*   **Industry Trends:**
    *   Mobile: 50-70%
    *   Desktop: 25-45%
    *   Tablet: 5-10%
*   **Suggestion:** Ensure your website uses a responsive design for a good experience on all devices.

### 11. Top Pages
*   **Meaning:** The most visited web pages.
*   **Why it's important:** Helps identify the most popular content and guide future content creation.
*   **Suggestion:** Analyze the common features of these pages to understand what attracts visitors most.

### 12. Geographic Distribution
*   **Meaning:** The countries/regions your visitors come from.
*   **Why it's important:** Helps to understand the geographic location of your target audience and optimize localization strategies.
*   **Suggestion:** Adjust content, language, and promotions based on major visitor regions.

### Experience Sharing
*   **Review Regularly:**
    *   Analyze data daily. Address any unusual data promptly.
    *   Review weekly or monthly to find anomalies and opportunities.
*   **Multi-dimensional Analysis:** A single metric can be misleading. Please analyze multiple metrics together.
*   **Set Baselines:** Record your baseline data to compare progress over time.
*   **Be Action-Oriented:** The purpose of data collection is to guide action. Remember, even small, continuous improvements can lead to significant results over time. Be patient.
